# Tetris Game in C++ using SFML

A **dynamic Tetris game** developed in **C++ using SFML** and **fundamental structured programming concepts (without OOP)** during my 2nd semester at FAST NUCES Islamabad.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Stack and clear rows of blocks by rotating and placing falling tetromino pieces. The game speeds up as you clear lines, increasing the challenge while providing an enjoyable experience.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Core Mechanics:**  
- Piece movement, rotation, collision detection, row clearing, and scoring.

✅ **SFML Graphics:**  
- Utilizes SFML to render the game board, pieces, and manage window events for smooth gameplay.

✅ **Dynamic Difficulty:**  
- Drop speed increases as levels progress to increase the challenge.

✅ **User Controls:**  
- Arrow keys for movement and rotation.
- Restart option for replayability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Library:** SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Concepts:** Structured programming with arrays, loops, conditionals, functions
- **Environment:** Visual Studio

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Strengthened understanding of real-time graphics and event handling using SFML.
- Improved logical problem-solving skills for implementing collision detection and game loops.
- Built foundational skills for game development workflows and user interaction handling in C++.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Ensure SFML is installed and linked in your Visual Studio project:**
    - Link `sfml-graphics`, `sfml-window`, `sfml-system` in your project settings.
    - Ensure SFML `bin` files are available in your executable's directory.

2. **Open the project in Visual Studio, build, and run.**

3. **Controls:**
    - Arrow keys: Move and rotate tetromino pieces
    - Down arrow key to speed up tetromino speed
    - P to pause to game

## 🙌 Contributions

This project is an educational project to strengthen fundamentals and learn SFML. Contributions to improve gameplay, add sound, or refactor are welcome!

### Enjoy the game and happy coding! 🎉
