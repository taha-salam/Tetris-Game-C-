/* PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTAL'S PROJECT FOR SPRING 2024 BS(SE)
 * You don't need to change anything in the driver code/main function except the part(s) where instructed.
 * You are expected to define your functionalities in the "functionality.h" header and call them here in the instructed part(s).
 * The game is started with a small box, you need to create other possible in "pieces.h" file in form of array.
    E.g., Syntax for 2 pieces, each having four coordinates -> int Pieces[2][4];
 * Load the images into the textures objects from img directory.
 * Don't make any changes to the "utils.h" header file except for changing the coordinate of screen or global variables of the game.
 * SUGGESTION: If you want to make changes in "utils.h", do it once you complete rest of the functionalities.
 * TIP: You can study SFML for drawing scenes, sprites and window.
